DatePalette
=============

This is beta release for js date-pickers replacements.

All may changed and go wrong!

You may watch, but not touch and its not for use at this time.

Summary
-------
DatePalette written at CoffeeScript with stitch as builder.

I try to use MVVM design pattern, Observer pattern and learn CoffeeScript at once time.


Setup
-------

1. Clone repository

2. Setup node modules `node install .`

Now, you can:

* Start node with stitch as dynamically compiling js as `cake run_server`
* Start static compiler to create .js and .min.js files as `cake coffee`
* Compile html test page from jade as `cake jade`

Now you can use DatePalette, as showed in /public/index.html
